Subject: Executive threatens to bypass Congress on voting rules

The system experienced critical failures this week as the executive branch announced plans to unilaterally impose voting requirements without legislative authorization. 9 of 12 democratic checks remain in FAILED state.

**Key Developments:**

- **Executive threatens voting law bypass.** Administration announced plans to implement voter ID requirements for 2026 midterms ["whether approved by Congress or not,"](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/trump-vows-voter-id-requirements-midterms-rcna259018) with [executive order floated](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5738317-trump-voter-id-executive-order/) if the SAVE Act stalls in Senate. Voting requirements have traditionally required congressional action under Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution.

- **DHS enters shutdown state.** The Department of Homeland Security [shut down operations](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/know-dhs-government-shutdown-happening-impacts-rcna259001) as negotiations between Democrats and the administration stalled. The shutdown represents a failure of basic legislative-executive coordination and impacts 260,000 employees.

**Dashboard Status:**

No status changes this week. **Election Infrastructure** remains AT RISK — this week's developments represent an escalation of existing threats but do not yet constitute full compromise. Monitoring closely for implementation attempts.

**Upcoming:**

- Senate action on SAVE Act and potential executive response
- Court challenges if executive order on voting requirements is issued

The separation of powers doctrine exists specifically to prevent unilateral executive control over election rules. Bypass attempts represent core system failures regardless of policy preferences on voter ID itself.
