Subject: Executive override of election law, journalist prosecution

Nine of twelve checks remain in failed state. This week saw explicit assertions of unilateral executive authority over election law and federal prosecution of a journalist for coverage of immigration enforcement.

**Critical incidents:**

- **Election infrastructure compromise escalates.** Trump [vowed to require voter ID](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-vows-to-require-voter-id-in-midterms-whether-approved-by-congress-or-not/) in midterm elections "whether approved by Congress or not." Election administration falls under congressional and state authority per Constitution Article I, Section 4. Executive order on voting requirements would constitute direct separation of powers violation.

- **Press freedom deterioration accelerates.** DOJ [charged journalist Don Lemon](https://www.axios.com/2026/02/13/don-lemon-plea-not-guilty-minnesota-church-protest) with crimes related to coverage of ICE operations at Minnesota church. First Amendment protections for newsgathering are well-established. Prosecution of reporter for coverage of federal operations represents textbook press freedom compromise.

- **Congressional oversight under surveillance.** House Democrats [launched investigation](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5738162-epstein-files-doj-bondi-house-democrats/) into reports DOJ tracked which lawmakers accessed Epstein files. If confirmed, executive branch monitoring of congressional document requests would directly undermine separation of powers and oversight independence.

- **Courts block partisan funding cuts.** Federal judge [blocked HHS](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/13/nx-s1-5713305/federal-funding-democratic-states-lawsuit) from rescinding health grants to Democratic-led states. Judicial intervention prevents executive branch from weaponizing statutory funding based on political affiliation. Represents functional check, though [enforcement remains uneven](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/u-s-citizens-detained-by-immigration-agents-describe-how-they-were-treated) in immigration cases.

- **FBI election records seizure details emerge.** ProPublica [reporting reveals](https://www.propublica.org/article/thomas-albus-fulton-county-georgia-election-records) coordination between Trump legal team and FBI regarding Georgia election records confiscation. Raises questions about FBI independence in politically sensitive investigations.

**Dashboard status:**

No status changes. Election Infrastructure elevated to FAILED based on explicit statements of intent to override congressional authority. Press Freedom remains COMPROMISED with active federal prosecution of journalist.

**Monitoring:**

Legal challenges to any executive order on election administration. Compliance metrics on court orders blocking funding cuts and requiring detainee legal access.

The system is designed with redundancy. When multiple checks fail simultaneously, recovery requires either executive self-restraint or coordinated institutional response. We're stress-testing which components still function under load.
