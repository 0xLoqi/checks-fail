Nine of twelve checks remain failed this week. New concerns around federal election interference and systematic force deployment against protesters.

**Dashboard Status**

No changes to overall status. Election Infrastructure remains AT RISK following Fulton County developments. Intelligence Community compromise confirmed by DNI's direct involvement in partisan investigation.

One bright spot: Grand juries continuing to serve as institutional check against politicized DOJ prosecutions, dismissing or refusing charges in multiple cases. [source](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5738221-grand-juries-trump-interference/)

**Monitoring**

ICE agreements with local police departments increased 400% in recent weeks—watch for civil rights litigation and sanctuary policy conflicts. NIH director vacancies create openings for political appointees to reshape federal research priorities.

The 'right people voting' language isn't subtle. Federal election interference doesn't always look like tanks at polling places.
