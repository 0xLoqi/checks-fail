Subject: Conviction erasure & watchdog suppression

The system experienced critical failures in independent oversight this week. DOJ moved to erase a contempt conviction for defying Congress while DHS demanded lists of ongoing internal investigations.

**Key developments:**

- **DOJ moves to dismiss Bannon contempt conviction.** After serving his sentence for defying a congressional subpoena, the Justice Department is now seeking to vacate the conviction entirely—an extraordinary step that undermines both judicial finality and congressional oversight authority.

- **DHS demands watchdog investigation lists.** The Department of Homeland Security requested a comprehensive list of ongoing investigations from its Inspector General—a move that threatens independent oversight and creates conditions for potential retaliation against internal critics.

- **Independent review blocked for fired federal workers.** The administration is moving to strip the Merit Systems Protection Board of authority to review terminations, eliminating judicial recourse for civil servants and removing a key check on executive power over the federal workforce.

- **Maxwell offers testimony for clemency.** Convicted sex trafficking conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell told Congress she'd "speak fully and honestly" if granted presidential clemency—conditioning cooperation with oversight on executive intervention in her criminal case.

**Dashboard status:**

No status changes. Congressional Oversight remains DEGRADED as DOJ actions continue to erode accountability for defying legislative subpoenas. Political Retribution remains WEAPONIZED with the Bannon dismissal adding to the pattern of selective enforcement.

**Monitoring:**

Watch for DHS Inspector General response to the investigation list demand and any similar requests to other agency watchdogs. The MSPB appeal process timeline will determine when fired workers lose independent review rights.

The system is designed to prevent any single component from having unchecked authority. When prosecutions become reversible based on political considerations and watchdogs must report their targets to those they're investigating, those checks stop functioning.
