Subject: Grand juries push back; courts v. executive escalates

This week saw multiple institutional checks activate against executive overreach, though the underlying pressure on democratic infrastructure continues to intensify. Grand juries refused political prosecutions, but the attempts themselves represent system degradation.

**Key Developments:**

- **Grand jury rejects DOJ's attempt to indict 6 Congressional Democrats** for protected speech criticizing military orders. The administration sought criminal charges; [the grand jury declined](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5732714-democrats-lawmakers-illegal-orders-video-indictment-fails/). System working, but the fact DOJ attempted prosecution of opposition lawmakers is the story. [Rep. Crow signals legal action](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/rep-crow-signals-legal-action-after-administrations-effort-to-indict-6-democrats).

- **DOJ fires U.S. attorney hours after judges appointed him.** Federal judges in New York selected an interim replacement; [DOJ immediately terminated him](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/justice-department-fires-u-s-attorney-in-new-york-hours-after-judges-picked-him-for-the-job/), creating direct executive-judicial conflict over prosecutorial independence.

- **AG Bondi possessed list of lawmaker's Epstein files "search history"** during congressional testimony. [CBS reports](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bondi-epstein-files-search-history-hearing-pramila-jayapal/) DOJ had Rep. Jayapal's document access logs during official oversight hearing, raising questions about surveillance of congressional investigators.

- **FBI seized Georgia 2020 election ballots based on debunked claims.** Federal agents raided Fulton County offices using [affidavits relying on long-disproven fraud allegations](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/10/nx-s1-5710649/fulton-county-2020-election-affidavit-fbi). [Nebraska ordered to hand over voter data](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/nebraska-hand-sensitive-voter-data-justice-department-after-130079992) to DOJ after court loss.

- **House passed SAVE America Act**, Trump-backed election bill [now headed to Senate](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-passes-save-america-act-trump-backed-election-bill-rcna258614). Major changes to election infrastructure and voter access rules under debate.

**Dashboard Status:**

No changes to overall system state. Judicial Independence remains STRAINED—courts continue ruling against administration actions, but enforcement remains inconsistent. Grand jury independence demonstrated this week is encouraging but doesn't override the pattern of DOJ weaponization attempts.

**Upcoming:**

AG Bondi faces [House oversight hearing](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/11/nx-s1-5707280/pam-bondi-oversight-hearing-department-of-justice) this week on DOJ independence concerns. SAVE Act moves to Senate—watch for debate over election infrastructure changes.

The checks are holding for now. But systems designed to never be tested this way degrade with each attempt.
