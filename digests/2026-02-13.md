Subject: Congressional surveillance, citizenship stripping operations

Nine of twelve critical checks remain in failed state. This week: alleged DOJ monitoring of lawmakers' search histories, expanded citizenship revocation programs, and judicial blocks on executive retaliation against a sitting senator.

**Key Developments:**

- **Separation of powers breach**: Multiple lawmakers [demand DOJ stop tracking](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/lawmakers-demand-doj-stop-tracking-lawmakers-epstein-files-searches-rcna258721) congressional access to classified Epstein files. DOJ allegedly monitoring which members of Congress search specific documents represents unprecedented surveillance of legislative branch. [Democrats eye legal action](https://www.axios.com/2026/02/12/pam-bondi-trump-spying-congress-doj-epstein) over what amounts to executive branch spying on congressional oversight activities.

- **Citizenship revocation scaled up**: Administration [expanding effort to strip citizenship](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/trump-administration-working-expand-effort-strip-citizenship-foreign-b-rcna255427) from naturalized Americans. Program bypasses century of settled constitutional law on naturalization process. No historical precedent for mass denaturalization operations at this scale.

- **Judicial check holds**: Federal judge [blocks Pentagon punishment](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-blocks-pentagon-from-downgrading-sen-mark-kellys-military-rank-pay/) of Sen. Mark Kelly for protected speech criticizing administration. Separate judge [orders return of Venezuelan men](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5735549-judge-boasberg-orders-return-venezuelan-men/) deported under Alien Enemies Act. Courts functioning, but [enforcement remains uneven](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5735302-trump-fires-upstate-ny-prosecutor/) as White House moves to remove judicial appointees.

- **DOJ independence test**: Republican senators [express relief](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5734392-republican-senators-defend-democrats/) that DOJ failed to secure indictments of Democratic lawmakers. The fact attempted retaliatory prosecutions reached grand jury stage confirms DOJ Independence status.

- **Regulatory rollback**: EPA [reverses its own climate endangerment finding](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/climate-change/epa-reverses-endangerment-climate-change-finding-rcna258452), stripping agency's authority to regulate emissions. Self-inflicted institutional capacity reduction.

**Dashboard Status:**

No status changes. Congressional Oversight downgraded to DEGRADED last week following alleged surveillance; this week confirms that assessment. Judicial Independence remains STRAINED—courts blocking executive overreach, but compliance inconsistent.

**Watching:**

Legal challenges to congressional surveillance. House vote on citizenship proof requirements for voting, which [passed committee](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/12/g-s1-109745/house-pushes-strict-requirement-for-voters) this week.

The system is designed to handle stress. We're documenting whether it does.
