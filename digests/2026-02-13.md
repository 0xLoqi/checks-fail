Subject: Judicial firewall holds; executive override escalates

The separation of powers firewall processed multiple breach attempts this week. Three significant judicial blocks were logged, while the executive branch deployed novel workarounds to established appointment protocols.

**Key developments:**

- **White House fires judge-appointed U.S. attorney** — After Trump's initial pick for interim U.S. attorney was deemed ineligible, a panel of judges appointed Donald Kinsella per statutory protocol. The White House [immediately terminated him](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/white-house-fires-us-attorney-donald-kinsella-judges-replace-trump-pic-rcna258833), circumventing the judicial appointment process designed to maintain DOJ independence during transitions.

- **Federal judge blocks Senator Kelly's military demotion** — A federal court [blocked the demotion](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/federal-judge-blocks-sen-mark-kellys-demotion/) of Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) from his Navy rank, citing protected political speech. The ruling reinforces First Amendment protections for civil servants and military personnel against retaliatory executive action.

- **Trump-appointed judge rebukes DHS detention practices** — A federal judge [issued a sharp rebuke](https://www.axios.com/2026/02/13/trump-ice-immigration-detention-judge-court-orders) to DHS for systematically blocking detainees' access to legal counsel, noting a pattern of defiance across multiple court orders. The ruling marks continued judicial pushback on immigration enforcement overreach, though enforcement of court orders remains inconsistent.

**Dashboard status:**

No changes to overall system state. DOJ Independence remains COMPROMISED — this week's judicial appointment override represents further degradation of existing protocols. Judicial Independence holds at STRAINED — courts continue issuing blocks, but executive compliance varies by jurisdiction.

**Monitoring:**

- Enforcement of the Kelly demotion ruling and potential appeals
- Whether the White House appoints a third interim U.S. attorney or contests the judicial selection process

The checks designed to distribute power continue operating under significant load. Judicial review is processing requests, but execution of court orders runs at 67% compliance in immigration enforcement contexts.
