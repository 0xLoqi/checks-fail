Subject: Intelligence routed through personal lawyers

Two critical failures this week in intelligence oversight and congressional accountability. The system continues degrading across multiple nodes.

**Key Developments:**

- **Intelligence agencies redirected to partisan legal operation.** The President [instructed spy agencies to provide intelligence](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-instructs-spy-agencies-provide-intelligence-stop-steal-lawyer-rcna258406) to his "Stop the Steal" lawyer. Intelligence community independence now directly compromised to support partisan election litigation.

- **DNI office blocked whistleblower access to Congress.** Gabbard's office [warned an attorney not to share classified complaints](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5731671-tulsi-gabbard-whistleblower-warning/) with congressional oversight committees. Statutory whistleblower protections and congressional intelligence oversight authority directly obstructed.

- **DOJ moves to dismiss Bannon contempt conviction.** Justice Department [seeks dismissal](https://www.axios.com/2026/02/10/trump-jan-6-steve-bannon-justice-department) of Steve Bannon's conviction for defying congressional subpoena. Congressional oversight authority further eroded through selective prosecution reversal.

- **FBI raid on Georgia election offices traced to Trump appointee.** Court documents [reveal](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/fbi-raided-georgia-election-hub-search-evidence-2020-voter-fraud-court-rcna258344) the Fulton County election infrastructure raid was driven by political appointees investigating debunked 2020 fraud claims. FBI independence compromised, election infrastructure targeted.

- **Federal funds threatened for Democratic states.** Administration [plans to withhold grant money](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/trump-administration-plans-hold-back-grant-money-democratic-130042262) from certain Democratic-led states. Selective enforcement of federal funding based on political alignment.

**Dashboard Updates:**

No status changes. Intelligence Community remains COMPROMISED. Congressional Oversight remains DEGRADED. All nine failed checks持续 offline.

Minor note: EPA moving to [revoke endangerment finding](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/10/epa-revoke-endangerment-finding-climate-regulations.html) that underpins climate regulation authority. Federal Programs degradation continues.

**Upcoming:**

Watch court response to DOJ's Lindsey Halligan appointment appeals in Comey and James cases. Judicial review of prosecutorial independence at issue.

Monitor congressional response to intelligence community routing through partisan legal channels and whistleblower obstruction attempts.

The system was designed with multiple redundancies. We're now testing whether any still function when executive agencies report through personal attorneys instead of institutional chains of command.
